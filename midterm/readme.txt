I will be basing my code on my huffman encoding python project (converting most of it into c). It's on my github if you want to check it out. My user is JerryYiyang
My functions regarding bmp files come from my project 1 and lab 4. Also, the huffman min heap implementation comes from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/huffman-coding-greedy-algo-3/#
I modified the code to fit my requirements.

The compressed pictures range around from 80% to 98% smaller. For flowers, it takse around 0.04 to compress and 0.045 to decompress

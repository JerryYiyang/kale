I will be basing my code on my huffman encoding python project (converting most of it into c). It's on my github if you want to check it out. My user is JerryYiyang
My functions regarding bmp files come from my project 1 and lab 4. Also, the huffman min heap implementation comes from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/huffman-coding-greedy-algo-3/#
I modified the code to fit my requirements.

hi profesor, im going to be completely honest i kinda gave up on this. ive spent around 40 hours working on it and i have no idea why it isn't doing what its supposed
to be doing. my code is pretty messy tbh so apologies for that. theoretically, my code is fine but obviously it's not. i understand its definitely issues with memory
but i've already spent so much time looking into it with the debugger and print statements and ive just given up. i implemented a fork and compressed using bits. 
for the smaller images the compression seems reasonable from what i hear floating around in that the compressed file is just a bit bigger.
for the larger images though, i'm not sure how but my compressed files are around 0.09% the size of the uncompressed file. i'm pretty confident in my 
compression code so hopefully its just good and not broken lol. for the time it takes, for the 2by2 files, for compression it takes around 0.001 and for decompression
it takes around 0.0008. i pray for your leniency and i'm cool coming in and talking about the project. thank you
